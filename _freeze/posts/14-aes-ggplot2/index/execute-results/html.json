I argued that it's just a pale imitation: you can't really fully replicate this package, it'll take a lot to FULLY replicate it, and it's TOO complicated for Python to replicate. \n\n<!-- # ```{r} -->\n<!-- #  -->\n<!-- # ``` -->\n\nThe thing is, R in general is functional; the arguments are _lazily evaluated_ by default and way similar to Lisp macros, where the AST can be transformed / modify during compile-time — you can pretty much . \n\n\n",
